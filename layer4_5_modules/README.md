# Layer 4.5 Customization Modules

We have developed several Layer 4.5 customization modules to help illustrate possible customizations and to perform experimentation.  The breakdown of this folder is as follows:

* sample_modules: Beginner modules to help illustrate how Layer 4.5 works with the flexible model that allows message buffering in the receive path.  Includes steps to perform Layer 4.5 customization using an echo client and server.  These modules include more comments that other modules will have.

* buffering: Modules developed specifically for testing the overhead of Layer 4.5 that mimic the NetSoft 22 submission. Modules include inserting tags into DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS connections.
