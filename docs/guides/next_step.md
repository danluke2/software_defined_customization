## Layer 4.5 Customized Modules

### Sample Modules

 - Beginner modules to help illustrate how Layer 4.5 works.  Includes steps to perform Layer 4.5 customization using an echo client and server.  These modules include more comments that other modules will have.

    > Sample modules don't use the NCO or user-space DCA component and focus on Layer 4.5 only

 - [Sample modules guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guides/next_step/sample_module)

### Netsoft Modules

 - Modules developed specifically for testing the overhead of Layer 4.5 and included in the NetSoft '22 paper.  Modules include inserting tags into DNS and HTTP connections.

### GENI Modules

 - Modules developed for the GENI networking environment.  These modules are used for testing Layer 4.5 over the open internet and for testing the NCO functionality to deploy modules to various networks on a rotating basis.

### Network-wide Customization Orchestrator (NCO) Modules

 - Modules that will be built by the NCO and deployed to the DCA (see experiment scripts)

### Buffering Modules

 - Modules designed to test the new buffering capability.  Includes an HTTPS module.

### Extra Modules

 - The extra folder contains modules under development which will be used for testing Layer 4.5 functionality.

## Replicate Demonstration Experiments:
 
 - To run experiments from the [NetSoft 22 Demo Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9844104){:target="_blank"}, see [NetSoft 22 Experiments]({{site.baseurl}}/guides/next_step/paper_exp)
